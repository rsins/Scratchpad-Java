You work for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service, as a Wildlife Trafficking Investigator.

This year's hot animal is the Canadian Lynx and your team is in the midst of a big case against Evil Trafficking Syndicate for $2.5 billion of illegal trafficking of this animal.
 
You are sifting through their paper trails to find more members of their nefarious network. 
You have a file of 5000 accounts where the ETS sent money recently. You are cross-referencing this file for suspicious activity.
 
The file is a list of account numbers, each 10 digits long. In order to better mask their tracks, they didn't use regular numbers, but instead a graphical representation of the numbers that look like:
 _    _  _     _  _ 
| | | _| _||_||_ |_ 
|_| ||_  _|  | _||_|

Example account number:
 _  _  _     _  _  _  _  _    
 _|| || ||_| _||_  _||_ |_ |_|
 _||_||_|  | _||_| _||_||_|  |

The account numbers only use the digits 0-6, are written over 3 lines, using pipes and underscores and each line has 30 characters. 
 
Questions to answer:

* You're particularly interested in transactions involving the Silva Casino, whose account numbers all have five consecutive 3s. 
  What are all the account numbers with five consecutive 3s in them?

Example:
3332432123 does NOT have 5 consecutive 3s in it
4213333313 does have 5 consecutive 3s in it
 
* Given the following checksum calculation, how many of the account numbers are valid?

Checksum:  (d0 + 2 * d1 + 3 * d2 + 4 * d3 + .. + 10 * d9) mod 12 = 0 where d0, d1... is the digit position in the 10 digit account number.

Example:
account number:   3  3  4  5  1  0  2  0  6  5
position names:  d0 d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 d8 d9

(3 + 2 * 3 + 3 * 4 + 4 * 5 + 5 * 1 + 6 * 0 + 7 * 2 + 8 * 0 + 9 * 6 + 10 * 5) mod 12 = 8 so this account number is NOT valid.
