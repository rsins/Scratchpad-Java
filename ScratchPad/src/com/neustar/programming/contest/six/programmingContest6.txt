You have one hour to answer as many questions as you can. Do not send your responses by email, but submit them to the following form: http://goo.gl/forms/WPsvLOHhmMMWhvf72
Only submit the form once, not each time you answer a question. Multiple submissions will be disqualified. 

Question 1:

Consider the following two query results:

SELECT count(*) AS total FROM orders;
+-------+
| total |
+-------+
|  100  |
+-------+

SELCT count(*) AS cust_1_total FROM orders WHERE customer_id = '1234';

+--------------+
| cust_1_total |
+--------------+
|      15      |
+--------------+

Given the above query results, and assuming there is one record where the customer_id is null, what is the count returned by this query: SELECT count(*) FROM orders WHERE customer_id <> '1234';

Question 2:

Counting up from 1, find the first prime number that has more than 5 digits and whose sides equal each other when the digits are added.
 
For a number with an even number of digits like 1234: the sides are 12 and 34. For a number with add odd number of digits, ignore the middle number, so for 12345, the sides are 12 and 45.
 
A 4 digit prime number that falls into such a category would be 1423, as both sides produce the same sum: 1+4 = 2+3.

Question 3:

You are an English professor researching Shakespeare. One of your collegue's says that Shakespeare was lazy and used the same words over and over in his plays. 
Not wanting to 'Brexit' from the college, you aim to prove him wrong.

Given the two files, hamlet.txt and romeoAndJuliet.txt, how many words do they have in common that start with either the letter e or y? 
 
The following sentence has four distinct words: "Laertes, son to Polonius."
The following sentence has no words: â€œ1604"
The following sentence has seven distinct words: "Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away."
The following sentence has eight distinct words: "Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow."
