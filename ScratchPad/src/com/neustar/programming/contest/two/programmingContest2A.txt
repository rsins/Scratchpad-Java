You are working at the local String Olympics and are running the vocabulary event. In this event, one string competes against another one. The strings are at least 1 char long.
The first string wins if it contains more z’s than the second string. If they have the same number of z’s, then the string with the most y’s wins. If they have the same number of y’s, then the number of x’s determines the winner, etc. If they contain the same number of z’s, y’s …. a’s, then it’s a tie and there is no winner. If either string contains the character sequence “no”, it is a tie. If either string contains a number or symbol, then it’s a tie. 

Each event contains two strings on a line, separated by a space. In this example, the second string wins:

abcdefg hijklmn

In this example, the first string wins:
zaay zaac

In this example, there is no winner:
post post

In this example, there is no winner:

adflkj# fawefkj

In this example, there is no winner:

awefnoafwe fakwjefzzzz

There are two answers needed. 
1) Given the input file, how many times does the first string of the pair win?
2) When the first string of the pair wins for the 68th time, what is that first string? 

Append 1 to 2 to the following to get your next question:

So for example if the first string of the pair won 500 times, and the first string that won for the 68th time was abcdef then the next problem is found at http://www.duocin.com/abcdef500
