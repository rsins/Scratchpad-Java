Simon likes to run, but very slowly and only in metric. Every day he runs, he runs 1 mm more than the day he last ran, starting with 1 mm on the first day.

On every 7th day, he doesn't run at all because he rests. He is also superstitious so on any day that contains both the number 1 and the number 3, he doesn't run.

Given a distance of 110 km, 54 m, 3 cm and 2 mm, how many days will it take before Simon has run that far cumulatively?
